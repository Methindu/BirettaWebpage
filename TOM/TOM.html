            only one or two of these weeks were used. Tensions were building as the time came closer and closer. For some, the only Tensions
            were the ones of the brawlstars matches they played.A spontanous challenge was also part of TOM, no details can be provided due 
            to restrictions. Celebrations took place in fried chicken restaraunts, certain students would have thoroughly enjoyed

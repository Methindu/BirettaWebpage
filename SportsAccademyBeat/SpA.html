            The biretta kids walk on to the court for a game of golden child.
            The opposition, 7A. The opposition are merciless, coming out of
            a daily haircut, they look fresh. The birettas will have a tough game if
            they want to win. The sports accademy are arrogant as ever. However, they
            must not forget that 7B have many sporting powerhouses, ones who chose
            brains over sports, legends like, Alex Harrak, Adithya Ganesan and 
            Mathew Middleton Pose a threat to 7A. Who will win. <br><br> 
            Nothing's going in for the sports accademy, the birettas are flying past.
            This is turning into quite the thrashing, 5 people across the line 
            already! Finally, a 7A kid gets one in, but 5 of us have already gotten safe.
            7A decided to lock in, it is closer now, a more neck to neck contest, 
            the cost of the rougn start is yet to be payed back. <br><br>
            Finally, it is time for the Mathew Middleton, the golden child to run,
            the last runner crosses the line, he is on his way, people sprint past,
            it is a chaotic scene, shots are taken and people run, accept this is fun.
            Not a shoot out. <br><br>
            7A get started, the birettas respond quickly as it doesnt take long at all
            for the first people to fall. It is still very close though. More people run
            It was more tense than the nba. An air ball could let a shallow lead slip.
            Eventually, the golden child is up, he runs past, freeing others, a shot goes in.
            we yell stop. Now we must wait for the results.<br><br>
            "Biretta, has won!" says the teacher. We all get up to celebrate. The "biggest
            nerds in the school", have got a win.
